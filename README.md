# studentreviewdashboard
Created a Student review dashboard project. 
which a student review portal is built by using PHP, SQL and CSS.
Here are the features of the system:

1.User Feedback Submission: Students can access the main page to input their details and provide feedback.
2.Admin Login: Staff members with admin privileges can log in using the designated admin button located on the main page.
3.Feedback Data Page: Upon successful login, administrators are redirected to the feedback data page. Here, they can view all the feedback responses displayed in a table format.
4.Logout Functionality: To ensure data security and privacy, a logout button is available. This enables users to log out, preventing unauthorized access to the feedback responses.
